# üöÄ Inception of Things: Introduction to Kubernetes with K3d and K3s using Vagrant

Welcome to the "Inception of Things" project, an immersive journey into the world of Kubernetes, with a specific emphasis on understanding K3d and K3s using Vagrant. This project is structured into three parts, each progressively building upon the knowledge gained in the preceding section.

## üåê Project Overview

This project offers a hands-on approach to learning Kubernetes, providing users with practical experience in deploying and managing applications on K3d and K3s through Vagrant. It aims to serve as a comprehensive introduction to Kubernetes, making it an invaluable learning opportunity for those eager to delve into this transformative technology.

## üîß Project Parts

### Part 1: Setting up K3s and Vagrant

In this section, we'll establish two virtual machines using Vagrant, with one in controller mode and the other in agent mode. The primary objective is to familiarize ourselves with the process of setting up K3s and Vagrant, gaining insights into how K3s operates.

### Part 2: Setting up K3s and Three Simple Applications

This part involves configuring a virtual machine with K3s in server mode and deploying three web applications. The aim is to deepen understanding of deploying applications on K3s and enhance comprehension of Kubernetes functionality.

### Part 3: Setting up K3d and Argo CD

Here, we'll set up K3d, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution within Docker, and Argo CD, a GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. This section focuses on understanding K3d and Argo CD, showcasing their utility in a production environment.

### üéÅ Bonus: Installing Helm 3 and GitLab

In addition to the main parts of the project, you can also install Helm 3 and GitLab to further immerse yourself in the world of Kubernetes. Helm 3 is a package management tool for Kubernetes, and GitLab is an open-source DevOps application. Instructions for Helm 3 installation can be found [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/), and for GitLab installation on Kubernetes, you can use the official Helm chart available [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/).

## üöß Getting Started

### Part 1: Setting up K3s and Vagrant (p1)

To begin with Part 1, follow these steps to set up K3s and Vagrant:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/inception-of-things.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory for Part 1: `cd inception-of-things/p1`

#### Controller Machine

3. In the `p1` directory, execute the following command to bring up the controller machine:

    ```bash
    vagrant up controller
    ```

4. Once the controller machine is up, you can SSH into it:

    ```bash
    vagrant ssh controller
    ```

#### Agent Machine

5. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `p1` directory.

6. Execute the following command to bring up the agent machine:

    ```bash
    vagrant up agent
    ```

7. Once the agent machine is up, you can SSH into it:

    ```bash
    vagrant ssh agent
    ```

### Part 2: Setting up K3s and Three Simple Applications (p2)

For Part 2, follow these steps to set up K3s and deploy three simple applications:

1. Navigate to the project directory for Part 2: `cd ../p2`

2. Execute the following command to bring up the virtual machine:

    ```bash
    vagrant up
    ```

3. Once the machine is up, you can SSH into it:

    ```bash
    vagrant ssh
    ```

### Bonus: Installing Helm 3 and GitLab

For the Bonus section, follow these steps to install Helm 3 and GitLab:

1. Navigate to the project directory for the Bonus: `cd ../bonus`

2. Execute the following command to bring up the virtual machine:

    ```bash
    vagrant up
    ```

3. Once the machine is up, you can SSH into it:

    ```bash
    vagrant ssh
    ```

These commands will set up the environments for each part, allowing you to explore and experiment with Kubernetes using K3s, Vagrant, Helm 3, and GitLab. Happy coding!

## üèÅ Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive introduction to Kubernetes and serves as a valuable learning opportunity for those interested in this technology. By following the guidelines and utilizing the resources provided, users can deepen their understanding of Kubernetes and gain experience with K3d and K3s. We hope that this project will help users become more proficient with Kubernetes and that it will serve as a starting point for further exploration of this exciting technology.
